# Procedural Landscapes
The purpose of this project is to explore procedural generation and perlin noise in processing, by generating and rendering landscapes.
The project is entirely written in Processing, with Java syntax.

# Island Generation
The central goal with this project was to write a program to generate and display procedurally generated islands using perlin noise.
By altering the output of the noise function, it became possible to alter the landscapes and create islands.
Several different landscape patterns have been hardcoded into the program, which may be utilized by uncommenting where appropriate.
